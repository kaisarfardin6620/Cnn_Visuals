CNN Visualizations Notebook

Overview

The cnn_visuals.ipynb Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive set of visualizations to analyze and interpret a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. It covers data exploration, model architecture, feature interpretability, model performance, and model comparison. This notebook is designed to help machine learning practitioners understand their data, model, and performance metrics effectively.

Table of Contents





Data and Preprocessing Visualizations





Displays sample original and augmented images from the training set.



Plots class distribution across training, validation, and test sets.



Notes on image resizing handled by ImageDataGenerator.



Model Architecture Visualizations





Prints a text summary of the CNN model's layers and parameters.



Generates a graphical representation of the model architecture (requires graphviz and pydot).



Feature and Interpretability Visualizations





Visualizes activation maps (feature maps) to show what features the CNN detects.



Displays the weights of the first convolutional layer to reveal learned patterns.



Generates Grad-CAM heatmaps to highlight regions important for predictions.



Model Performance Visualizations





Plots training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.



Displays a confusion matrix to show prediction performance.



Provides a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.



Plots ROC curves and AUC scores for multi-class classification.



Shows sample predictions with confidence scores.



Model Comparison Visualizations





Compares training histories (loss and accuracy) of multiple models.



Displays a bar chart comparing final validation loss and accuracy across models.

Prerequisites

Software





Python 3.x



Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the notebook.



Graphviz: Required for model architecture visualization (system installation).





Install on your system (e.g., sudo apt-get install graphviz on Ubuntu, or brew install graphviz on macOS).



Ensure Graphviz is added to your system's PATH.

Python Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pandas opencv-python pydot graphviz

Data Requirements





A dataset of images organized in a format compatible with ImageDataGenerator (e.g., a DataFrame with image paths and labels).



Predefined train_df, val_df, and test_df Pandas DataFrames containing image_path and label columns.



A trained Keras CNN model (model) and its training history (history).



Constants IMG_HEIGHT and IMG_WIDTH defining the target image size.

Usage





Prepare Your Environment:





Ensure all prerequisites are installed.



Set up your dataset and ensure train_df, val_df, and test_df are correctly defined.



Train your CNN model and store its training history.



Run the Notebook:





Open cnn_visuals.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.



Execute the cells sequentially to generate visualizations.



Ensure the train_generator, test_generator, model, and history objects are defined before running the cells.



Customize as Needed:





Adjust visualization parameters (e.g., figure sizes, number of images to display).



Modify the ImageDataGenerator augmentation parameters to match your preprocessing pipeline.



Update layer names for Grad-CAM or feature map visualizations based on your model's architecture.



Interpret Outputs:





Use the visualizations to diagnose data imbalances, model performance, and learned features.



Check for overfitting by comparing training and validation metrics.



Analyze Grad-CAM heatmaps to understand model decision-making.

Notes





The notebook assumes a categorical classification task with multiple classes.



For Grad-CAM, the last convolutional layer is automatically selected, but you may need to adjust the last_conv_layer_name if your model has a different structure.



Model comparison requires multiple model histories. The provided code includes a dummy second model for demonstration; replace it with your actual model histories.



Visualization of the model architecture requires pydot and graphviz. If not installed, a warning will be printed with installation instructions.

Example Output





Sample Images: 3x3 grids of original and augmented images with class labels.



Class Distribution: Bar plots showing the number of images per class in each dataset split.



Model Architecture: A diagram of the CNN layers saved as model_architecture.png.



Activation Maps: Feature maps from convolutional layers showing detected patterns.



Grad-CAM: Heatmaps overlaid on input images highlighting important regions.



Performance Plots: Loss and accuracy curves, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and sample predictions.
